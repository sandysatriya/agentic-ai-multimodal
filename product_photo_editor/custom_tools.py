    """Modify an existing product photo or combine multiple product photos.

    This tool lets you make changes to product photos. You can:
    - Edit a single photo (change background, lighting, colors, etc.)
    - Combine multiple products into one photo (arrange them side by side, create bundles, etc.)

    **IMPORTANT**:
    - Make ONE type of change per tool call (background OR lighting OR props OR arrangement)
    - For complex edits, chain multiple tool calls together
    - BE AS DETAILED AS POSSIBLE in the change_description for best results!

    Args:
        change_description: What do you want to do? BE VERY DETAILED AND SPECIFIC!

                          **The more details you provide, the better the result.**
                          Focus on ONE type of change, but describe it thoroughly.

                          For BACKGROUND changes:
                          - "change background to soft pure white with subtle gradient from top to bottom, clean and minimal aesthetic"
                          - "replace background with rustic dark wood table surface with natural grain texture visible, warm brown tones"

                          For ADDING PROPS:
                          - "add fresh pink roses and eucalyptus leaves arranged naturally around the product on the left and right sides,
                            with some petals scattered in front"
                          - "add fresh basil leaves and cherry tomatoes scattered around the product naturally"

                          For LIGHTING changes:
                          - "add soft natural window light coming from the left side at 45 degree angle, creating gentle shadows on the
                            right side, warm morning atmosphere"
                          - "increase brightness with soft diffused studio lighting from above, eliminating harsh shadows"

                          For ARRANGEMENT/POSITIONING:
                          - "reposition product to be perfectly centered in frame with equal space on all sides"
                          - "arrange these three products in a horizontal line, evenly spaced with 2 inches between each"

                          Note: When combining multiple products, you can include background/lighting in the initial arrangement since it's
                                one cohesive setup
        image_artifact_ids: List of image IDs to edit or combine.
                          - For single image: provide a list with one item (e.g., ["product.png"])
                          - For multiple images: provide a list with multiple items (e.g., ["product1.png", "product2.png"])
                          Use multiple images to combine products into one photo.

    Returns:
        dict with keys:
            - 'tool_response_artifact_id': Artifact ID for the edited image
            - 'tool_input_artifact_ids': Comma-separated list of input artifact IDs
