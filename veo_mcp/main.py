    This function uses an image as the first frame of the generated video and automatically
    enriches your prompt with professional video production quality guidelines to create
    high-quality marketing assets suitable for commercial use.

    AUTOMATIC ENHANCEMENTS APPLIED:
    - 4K cinematic quality with professional color grading
    - Smooth, stabilized camera movements
    - Professional studio lighting setup
    - Shallow depth of field for product focus
    - Commercial-grade production quality
    - Marketing-focused visual style

    PROMPT WRITING TIPS:
    Describe what you want to see in the video. Focus on:
    - Product actions/movements (e.g., "rotating slowly", "zooming into details")
    - Desired camera angles (e.g., "close-up of the product", "wide shot")
    - Background/environment (e.g., "minimalist white backdrop", "lifestyle setting")
    - Any specific details about the product presentation

    The system will automatically enhance your prompt with professional production quality.

    Args:
        prompt: Description of the video to generate. Focus on the core product presentation
                you want. The system will automatically add professional quality enhancements.
        image_data: Base64-encoded image data to use as the starting frame
        negative_prompt: Optional prompt describing what to avoid in the video
